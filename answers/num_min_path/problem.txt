Given a weighted directional graph, and two nodes start and end, output the number of different paths from start to end such that the total length is minimal.

Example:
1-->2 edge length 1
1-->3 edge length 2
2-->4 edge length 3
3-->4 edge length 2

start=1 end=4
Then we have 2 minimal paths: 1-->2-->4 and 1-->3-->4

Input format:
First line n, m, s t, indicating the number of vertices and edges in the graph, the path needs to start at s and end at t.
In the following m lines, each line 3 numbers, a,b,l: it means a directional edge from a to b with length l. 
Note directional edge means, you cannot use this edge from b to a.

Output format:
Two numbers, the first number is the length of the min path.
The second number is the number of ways to form the min path.
