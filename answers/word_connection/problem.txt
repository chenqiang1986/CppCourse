Given a list of words, a starting word, and an ending word.

Find the smallest total overlap length of the sequence of words from the given list such that
1. The first word is the starting word.
2. The last word is the ending word.
3. Any adjacent two words, must have the property that the previous word's some suffix is the next words's some prefix.

Overlap length is the length of the string with words connected while ignoring the common part.

Example:

Given:

abc
bcd
def

with starting='abc' and ending='def'.

The shortest sequence is ['abc', 'bcd', 'def'], the overlap length is 6, because the connected string is 'abcdef'.
Note that when connecting 'abc' and 'bcd' together, we get 'abcd', with 'bc' being the common part, we do not repeat.

Input format
First line N -- number of words
Next N lines each line a word.
Next 1 line containing starting word.
Next 1 line containing ending word.

Output
A number meaning the smallest total overlap length of the sequence.
